👩🏽‍💻 About the Project
The Eyespy, an app that alerts sleepy students to wake up by sounding an alarm. This app also helps sleepy/ distracted drivers to be awake and not cause accidents.  
The idea for this app came to me during the Covid time, when the classes were online and the students were expected to be in front of their computers due to classes being held online.To solve this problem I decided to create this app that detects if a user is asleep or not.
